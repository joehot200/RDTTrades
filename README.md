# RDTTrades

Trade log.

Workflow is: ToS -> Email -> Zapier -> Github.

Zapier may have a slight delay.
"Timestamp" = Gmail timestamp (trade received from ToS).
"Time Received (Github)" = Zapier timestamp (trade sent to github from zapier).


Raw trades (trades folder) are compiled into trades.json.
